### Note for hackathon reviewers:
- This README was partly created by AI
- The showcase can be found in my submission repository
- The code can be found under [/lib](https://github.com/HumanBot000/SnapQuest/tree/master/lib)
- The format follows the standard conventions for dart and flutter
- The app isn't enrolled in any Appstores but can be downloaded from the releases section of this repository
- I added a debug button to the matchmakign to start the game instant. This is helpful for testing, because it eliminates the need to simulate 10 real clients
